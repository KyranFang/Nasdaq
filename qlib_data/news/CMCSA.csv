But what exactly are green bonds? Green bonds allow companies to raise funds for new and existing projects that benefit the environment. These projects can revolve around sustainability areas like clean transportation and renewable energy. The idea being companies can shift to more sustainable practices while funding the transition at a lower cost. There are rules for these bonds. They must be used for green projects only. Issuers of the bonds must lay out the criteria used to evaluate proposals. Proceeds from the bonds need to be tracked and information must be shared about those proceeds as well as the impact of those projects. Who can issue these bonds? Governments, non-profits, banks and corporations. Rivian isn't the only company to issue green bonds this year. Comcast (CMCSA) announced a $1 billion green bond sale. And VF Corporation (VFC) issued its second green bond for more than $500 million. See the full interview with Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith here.

Washington Post media reporter Elahe Izadi says digital media organizations made the following claims early on, ""We are the future of media. We can attract millennials, younger audiences, newspapers are dying, print is dying, and this is really the future and they sold this promise, and as we can see, they couldn't grow fast enough to make up for those promises, especially when we're now in an economic environment where the advertising industry and the and the advertising revenue has dropped off."" Its potential downfall underscores the tough environment facing digital media companies as they struggle to cut spending during economic uncertainty. ""When we're talking digital media... during the pandemic and especially at the start, we actually saw audience spike, there was a lot of online interest, reader interest saw a lot of that happening, but that didn't necessarily mean an increase in revenues,"" Elahe Izadi said. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Izadi also says that in the case of companies relying on other companies like those who rely on Google (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), their businesses can also be susceptible to disruptions from something like a changed algorithm.

Recently, media mogul Barry Diller warned of consequences for studios if they continue partnering with streaming companies like Netflix (NFLX). MNTN CEO Mark Douglas joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the comments. “If you look at the economics on it, I’m not sure how that quite works,” Douglas says. Douglas notes that Disney (DIS) “did about $10 billion in studio revenue last year,” whereas Netflix (NFLX) did “three times that, just by themselves. So they’re the size of like a couple of major studios combined, so I don’t know how you take an industry that seems to be largely striking over streaming and try to separate it out.” “Whenever these studios are in trouble, it’s like the finance team takes over and it just doesn’t make sense,” Douglas says. “These studios have to meet consumers where they are. The consumer sees no difference,” Douglas discusses. Douglas also notes that this is “not new. All this talk was on DVDs,” 20, 30 years ago as well. “Every time there’s a new technology, it’s like everyone’s up in arms over it. And so, bottom line, focus on the consumer, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and... we can go forward with everyone entertained and the industry in a healthy state,” Douglas adds., Headline: Unveiling Comcast (CMCSA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?
