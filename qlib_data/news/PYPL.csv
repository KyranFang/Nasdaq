All the big retail names were there including the tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and PayPal (PYPL), as well as giants of main street such as Foot Locker (FL) and Walmart (WMT). First, AI - artificial intelligence - is having its moment. It’s the ultimate buzzword in the field of investing, and AI was definitely on display at Shoptalk 2023. Tech companies are working with retailers to monetize a lot of the big data they’re collecting in real time. “I think as we see this next generation of AI it’s really powerful. And I think one of the most important questions out there is what are people going to ask it to do?” Pinterest CEO Bill Ready told us. The second major trend at Shoptalk was shipping. Retailers are battling to get all those products you buy online to your doorstep even faster. Shipt, which is owned by Target (TGT), is one of the big players. Twenty two billion packages are shipped every year in the United States according to a recent study by Pitney Bowes (PBI). The size of the package delivery market in the U.S. is expected to hit $157B this year, helping to explain the focus at Shoptalk on delivery solutions. The third big trend at Shoptalk was buy now, pay later. Companies like Affirm (AFRM) and Klarna are among the leaders. According to a recent survey, more than half of all consumers in the U.S. said they were currently using a buy now, pay later service.

He joined Yahoo Finance to discuss the growing buy now pay later space. Siemiatkowski said he loves Apple (AAPL) Pay, but it hasn’t caught up to Klarna yet, “there’s so many limitations that it will take years before this product has any potential significant impact on what we’re doing.” When it comes to other major companies in the space, Siemiatkowski said that in his 18 years in the business Klarna has stayed competitive. “First it was like Paypal (PYPL) is too big and they were going to kill us in the Nordics and they were going to kill us in the German speaking countries, and then they were going to kill us in the UK and here we are now killing them in the U.S.,” he said. Where Siemiatkowski is worried about competition is startups, not tech giants. “It's the startups and the new people coming with new, great ideas moving at super slight speed. Those are the ones you should be worried about as a company,” he said. Watch the full interview with Seana Smith and Dave Briggs here.
