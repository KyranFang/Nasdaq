Snyder’s asking price would set a new record for the highest sports sale ever, trumping the Denver Broncos $4.65 billion sale last year. But there could still be a case for why the Commanders are worth the price. There’s the obvious point that many think owning an NFL team is fun and beneficial to their image. Jerry Jones told Yahoo Finance in September that he wouldn’t sell the Dallas Cowboys for $10 billion. But there’s also underlying value. In 2021, the Green Bay Packers were 70 percent of the way to profitability before even playing a down, due to the NFL’s generous shared revenue model. Combine that, with consistent franchise valuations over time and the increased involvement of big tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL), the NFL’s growth story is likely to continue.

It’s South by Southwest, an annual celebration that’s billed as both a conference and a festival, or somewhere in the middle, but as organizers and veterans will tell you, ‘you just have to be there.’ It’s a mashup of film, music, tech, and culture. A place where you can watch Ironman lecture a crowd on cyber-security, receive healthcare advice from the Jonas Brothers, and watch a movie premiere in virtual reality, all in one afternoon. But why is this happening? And who’s going? Well, everyone- fans, entrepreneurs, thrill seekers, investors, and they’re all going for the same reason- they’re looking for the next big thing. For the first time in a long time, the tech sector is experiencing a transformation. You’ve read about it in the news, heard about it in the break room, and you’ve seen it with your own eyes on social media. I’m talking about AI and what some are calling “deep tech” – those scientific advancements which include innovations in areas like virtual reality and robotics. Between star studded conversations and out-of-this-world exhibits, SXSW will give us a sneak peak into the future and how these new technologies will change our economy and our world, from the way we work, to the way we play. We’ll be speaking to the top thinkers and up and coming entrepreneurs about what all of this means for both businesses and consumers, because we’re on the edge of a brand new era in modern technology, and SXSW is the main stage. Over the past few years, there’s been a shift in how we think about the tech industry and the emergence of a new capital city for American business. Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL)— why are the world’s most valuable companies all moving to Austin, Texas? Could it be the weather? The taxes? The food? Or maybe it’s the vibe?

And with a potential ban on the horizon, you might be wondering if you should just kick your TikTok habit now rather than going cold turkey later. But doing that will require more than just deleting the app from your phone. If you really want to give up TikTok, you’ll have to delete your account as well. Thankfully, it’s a relatively painless process, though the platform, like other social media companies, will certainly try to get you to stick around. To finally kick your TikTok habit, you’ll first want to go to your profile page by tapping the Profile button in the bottom right corner of the home screen. Select the options menu, by pressing the hamburger button in the top right of the screen, and tap Settings and Privacy in the pop-up window. Next press Account, then select Deactivate or Delete Account, and pick Delete account permanently. From there you can choose to download your old TikTok videos to save them offline, or you can just kiss them all goodbye by tapping the confirm button at the bottom of the screen.

He joined Yahoo Finance to discuss the growing buy now pay later space. Siemiatkowski said he loves Apple (AAPL) Pay, but it hasn’t caught up to Klarna yet, “there’s so many limitations that it will take years before this product has any potential significant impact on what we’re doing.” When it comes to other major companies in the space, Siemiatkowski said that in his 18 years in the business Klarna has stayed competitive. “First it was like Paypal (PYPL) is too big and they were going to kill us in the Nordics and they were going to kill us in the German speaking countries, and then they were going to kill us in the UK and here we are now killing them in the U.S.,” he said. Where Siemiatkowski is worried about competition is startups, not tech giants. “It's the startups and the new people coming with new, great ideas moving at super slight speed. Those are the ones you should be worried about as a company,” he said. Watch the full interview with Seana Smith and Dave Briggs here.

It's $3,499 price tag however may turn off a lot of buyers. Laura Martin, Senior Media and Internet Analyst at Needham & Co., however, has an idea. Martin suggests that Apple (AAPL) should buy Disney (DIS) to help build adoption of the new headset. Martin argues that Apple needs ""a compelling content storytelling use case"" for the Vision Pro to gain traction. She believes that with Disney's content, more people may be willing to purchase the headset. But what about the Disney parks? Martin says Apple likely won't want the parks, but that those could be spun off or sold, given they are ""really a good business, standalone."" Martin also covers Warner Bros Discovery (WBD). When asked about the ousting of CNN CEO Chris Licht, Martin says investors are betting more on WBD leadership than who is leading CNN. She also makes the case for WBD keeping CNN in its portfolio. ""The only way to win the streaming wars is you must have entertainment content, and you must have news, and you must have live sports,"" Martin says, because when news breaks, it drives viewers to your app. When it comes to the ongoing writers strike and a potential strike from SAG-AFTRA, Martin tells Yahoo Finance Live's Diane King Hall and Alexandra Canal that Wall Street investors will ultimately be the winners because ""all of these companies are not going to be able to spend money on content and that won't be a competitive disadvantage.""

After the meeting concluded, Meta's President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg told Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Allie Garfinkle that he believes all the tech companies at the meeting want to move AI technology forward quickly, but responsibly, adding that Meta is ""absolutely determined to follow-up and honor these commitments."" Clegg doesn't share the fears that some have of AI, saying that some of predictions ""have slightly run ahead of the technology."" Clegg does say concerns about things like deep fakes and the manipulation of audio and video are ""legitimate,"" but that ""the technology which generates that unwelcome material is also the technology we will use to actually identify and control it."" On regulation, Clegg said it is ""definitely"" needed, but that companies are not ""going to sit around an wait for legislation,"" noting that's part of the reason why these voluntary commitments are being made. One of the big concerns about AI is how it can be used to create misinformation or disinformation that could impact an election.

Constellation Research Founder Ray Wang and Technalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O’Donnell joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the report. O'Donnell says the results were ""not bad"" considering the overall decline in smartphone sales. Wang agreed, calling the report ""much better than expected."" As Wang points out, what is key for Apple is ""how much many they can make per device. It's not about total iPhone sales. And what they were able to show is that services that services is continuing to grow and the non-iPhone sales around wearables is also picking up. Those two are complimentary."" When it comes to its international business, Apple has been focusing a lot on India. O'Donnell says ""it is going to be incredibly important"" to Apple down the line. However, there will be a couple of challenges for Apple in the country too. First, he says ""we haven't see as many premium phones, in general, sell there,"" though he says Apple does have some older models it could sell there. O'Donnell's second point is that ""I think we are going to see some slower attach to services there,"" noting that services are not used to the degree they are in other markets. On the plus side though, O'Donnell says Apple has ""almost no install base in India, it's extraordinarily small. So, the great thing is, it's almost nothing but upside for them there."", Headline: Amazon Beats, Apple Disappoints as Earnings Pour In, source:Yahoo, summary: The report has helped give bears some ammunition, but Apple is a stock that the market tends to love no matter what, so we can expect an intense battle in the days ahead., Headline: Trump arraigned in D.C., Amazon earnings, Apple's declining revenue: Top Stories, source:Yahoo, summary: President Trump pleads not guilty to Federal charges tied to his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

The stock is down 4.8% so far in August, putting it on pace for its worst month since December 2022, when it fell 12%., Headline: Economy: We have a ‘goldilocks scenario,’ strategist says, source:Yahoo, summary: Many investors believe the Federal Reserve will skip raising rates at its next meeting in September. Right now, it’s shaping up to be a “goldilocks” scenario, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes tells Yahoo Finance Live. “We finally have a goldilocks scenario where the slowing is starting to kick in, the lagged effect is starting to kick in, and more than anything what that means for the Fed is it gives them cover to actually pause in September, which is kind of priced into the markets right now,” Hayes says. Although many investors believe the Fed will hike in November, “we are going to get a lot of inflation data between now and then” and “if those numbers continue to come in a little bit softer, the Fed may be done in terms of hiking, not done with tightening cause they’ll keep rates elevated for a little while,” which “creates this perfect scenario for stocks moving forward,” Hayes explains. Hayes also notes that with some softness in the labor market, quit rates declining, job openings softening, “that creates an environment where you're not going to have the wage price spiral, where you're not going to see this accelerating wage inflation, and that’s going to give a lot of comfort to the Fed.” Let the Fed “keep rates elevated” and have this “perfect situation where the economy is slowing a little bit, but the Fed is done tightening and then companies can start to perform,” Hayes explains. Hayes says for people expecting the “Magnificent 7,” Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA), “to have a monster second half like they had the first half, I think they're going to be a little surprised.”, Headline: Top Research Reports for Apple, Broadcom & Caterpillar, source:Yahoo, summary: Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc.

The consumer sees no difference,” Douglas discusses. Douglas also notes that this is “not new. All this talk was on DVDs,” 20, 30 years ago as well. “Every time there’s a new technology, it’s like everyone’s up in arms over it.
