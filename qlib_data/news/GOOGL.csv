Current owner Dan Syder is seeking roughly seven billion dollars for the NFL franchise, according to reports. Snyder’s asking price would set a new record for the highest sports sale ever, trumping the Denver Broncos $4.65 billion sale last year. But there could still be a case for why the Commanders are worth the price. There’s the obvious point that many think owning an NFL team is fun and beneficial to their image. Jerry Jones told Yahoo Finance in September that he wouldn’t sell the Dallas Cowboys for $10 billion. But there’s also underlying value. In 2021, the Green Bay Packers were 70 percent of the way to profitability before even playing a down, due to the NFL’s generous shared revenue model. Combine that, with consistent franchise valuations over time and the increased involvement of big tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL), the NFL’s growth story is likely to continue.

The website’s tally of 2023 global tech layoffs has gone up almost fivefold since mid-January., Headline: Breaking down anchored VWAP with AlphaTrends.net Founder Brian Shannon, CMT: YF Uncut, source:Yahoo, summary: Volume weighted average price (VWAP) was created in 1988 as a benchmark for institutions to determine the quality of their order execution. It is the average price for the day, weighted by volume, with each share traded getting equal weight. The cumulative average builds throughout the day, and if more volume comes in on an up move, the VWAP will rise, but if more volume comes in as the market moves lower, the VWAP will decline, and prices will be below it. According to veteran trader and alphatrends.net founder Brian Shannon, CMT, we can determine with 100% accuracy who has control at the beginning of the day based on where the VWAP is in relation to it. When thinking about support and resistance levels, traders use the word ""porosity,"" which is similar to drawing a trendline with a crayon instead of a straight edge, where the VWAP becomes a battleground in that area. He calls them levels of interest rather than levels of resistance. The anchored VWAP initiated from the all-time high for the NASDAQ, for instance. It measures sentiments with precision and tells us that from that top, the average long participant is losing money because the price is lower than the average, while the average short seller is making money. Shannon advises that as the market comes up to the anchored VWAP, not only will long people be looking to break even, but short sellers might put a big offer on there and try to scare the long holders out of it. He sees it as a transition of a balance of power, and if buyers are able to wrestle away control and take control of the trend, prices can re-emerge in a new uptrend supported by the average participant being in a profitable position and the average short seller scrambling to cover their losses. Shannon advises looking at the shorter-term timeframe for trend alignment and measuring sentiment and psychology to determine who is in control from a particular event. He suggests measuring VWAP from an event and looking for the first couple of days or two, where buyers gain control, and then a battle ensues where sellers regain control.

However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape., Headline: Weekly comic: Make way for Generative AI, source:Yahoo, summary: By Geoffrey Smith, Headline: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Responds to Shareholders’ Push For Change, source:Yahoo, summary: In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, Salesforce Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff sounded off on the activist investors targeting Salesforce by pressing for seats on the company’s board of directors. Benioff said he welcomed the new board members and said they’ll be great for the company and its shareholders. “We have three great new board members, and that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible” Benioff said. The three new boardroom hires at Salesforce are Sachin Mehra, Mastercard’s Chief Financial Officer; Mason Morfit, ValueAct Capital’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Arnold Donald, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation. Benioff had particular praise for Donald: “probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world” he told Yahoo Finance. Benioff however, did not mention the more aggressive activists targeting Salesforce, specifically Elliott Management or Starboard Value. Benioff spoke to Yahoo Finance after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter. Some analysts mused that the blowout results could also help Benioff outflank the activists currently circling his company., Headline: Big US Stocks` Q4`22 Fundamentals, source:TalkMarkets, summary: No summary, Headline: Capitalize on the Emerging Age of AI for Hefty Profits, source:InvestorPlace, summary: No summary, Headline: Tracking George Soros's Portfolio - Q4 2022 Update, source:SeekingAlpha, summary: George Soros' 13F portfolio value increased from $5.86B to $7.26B this quarter.

It’s South by Southwest, an annual celebration that’s billed as both a conference and a festival, or somewhere in the middle, but as organizers and veterans will tell you, ‘you just have to be there.’ It’s a mashup of film, music, tech, and culture. A place where you can watch Ironman lecture a crowd on cyber-security, receive healthcare advice from the Jonas Brothers, and watch a movie premiere in virtual reality, all in one afternoon. But why is this happening? And who’s going? Well, everyone- fans, entrepreneurs, thrill seekers, investors, and they’re all going for the same reason- they’re looking for the next big thing. For the first time in a long time, the tech sector is experiencing a transformation. You’ve read about it in the news, heard about it in the break room, and you’ve seen it with your own eyes on social media. I’m talking about AI and what some are calling “deep tech” – those scientific advancements which include innovations in areas like virtual reality and robotics. Between star studded conversations and out-of-this-world exhibits, SXSW will give us a sneak peak into the future and how these new technologies will change our economy and our world, from the way we work, to the way we play. We’ll be speaking to the top thinkers and up and coming entrepreneurs about what all of this means for both businesses and consumers, because we’re on the edge of a brand new era in modern technology, and SXSW is the main stage. Over the past few years, there’s been a shift in how we think about the tech industry and the emergence of a new capital city for American business. Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL)— why are the world’s most valuable companies all moving to Austin, Texas? Could it be the weather? The taxes? The food? Or maybe it’s the vibe?

Krach, who served as former under secretary of state in the Trump administration, says the app monitors private information like bank records and location data. The app, which is ultimately owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has also seen criticism for allegations of censorship, access of U.S. user data, and propaganda concerns. TikTok's ownership has made it a long-running target by the U.S. government, with the Trump Administration saying in 2020 it would ban the app. TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before Congress today in the hopes of addressing some of these concerns. The executive said TikTok pledged commitments in four key areas: it would keep teenager safety a top priority, prevent unauthorized foreign access of U.S. user data, commit to free expression, and will be transparent and give access to monitors. Critics say the commitments do not go far enough. ""This app is built to be weaponized,"" says Keith Krach, chairman of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue.

And with a potential ban on the horizon, you might be wondering if you should just kick your TikTok habit now rather than going cold turkey later. But doing that will require more than just deleting the app from your phone. If you really want to give up TikTok, you’ll have to delete your account as well. Thankfully, it’s a relatively painless process, though the platform, like other social media companies, will certainly try to get you to stick around. To finally kick your TikTok habit, you’ll first want to go to your profile page by tapping the Profile button in the bottom right corner of the home screen. Select the options menu, by pressing the hamburger button in the top right of the screen, and tap Settings and Privacy in the pop-up window.

Concerns still abound however, and a well-known figure has entered the chat. Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai told '60 Minutes' artificial intelligence could be very ""harmful"" if used incorrectly, and called for further regulatory frameworks. That's a sentiment echoed by Douglas Rushkoff, Professor of Media Theory and Digital Economics at CUNY; he told Yahoo Finance Live that regulation is ""a necessary framework."" The conversation was timely, with EU lawmakers reportedly drawing up plans to regulate the space with a new set of tailored rules. The U.S. Commerce Department has also set out its stall; it's currently fielding opinions on the need for A.I. audits and risk assessments. Rushkoff says that when it comes to regulating artificial intelligence, the easiest way ""isn't to change what A.I.s do, it's to change what we do."" ""Raising A.I. is a bit like raising children,"" he adds, ""they're going to listen to whatever is going on in the room.""

With the Federal Reserve's next policy announcement coming up in May, investors are looking for light at the end of the rate-hike tunnel. Kenny Polcari, Kace Capital Advisors Managing Partner, tells Yahoo Finance that a Fed pause could be a benefit for the tech industry. Last week's weekly jobless claims bolstered bets that the Fed may pause its interest rate-hike cycle in an effort to tame inflation. ""I think the cuts come in 2024, and then I would expect tech to continue to perform well,"" Polcari says. If the Fed is forced into another position to raise rates due to rising inflation, Polcari says it would be bad for the industry. ""Tech isn't going to like that, and investors are going to take money out [of tech]...and a bunch of areas of tech...will immediately come under pressure,"" he says.

Clegg doesn't share the fears that some have of AI, saying that some of predictions ""have slightly run ahead of the technology."" Clegg does say concerns about things like deep fakes and the manipulation of audio and video are ""legitimate,"" but that ""the technology which generates that unwelcome material is also the technology we will use to actually identify and control it."" On regulation, Clegg said it is ""definitely"" needed, but that companies are not ""going to sit around an wait for legislation,"" noting that's part of the reason why these voluntary commitments are being made. One of the big concerns about AI is how it can be used to create misinformation or disinformation that could impact an election.

After its conclusion, Clegg joined Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Allie Garfinkle to shed light on what was discussed. One of the big concerns about AI is how it could be used to spread misinformation or disinformation in a way that could impact an election. Clegg says that Meta's systems, including the ones related to AI, will ""tackle"" malicious or nefarious content ""regardless of where its created, whether it's created by a human being or by a machine."" Clegg adds that Meta has spent $16 billion over the last few years on defensive and protective systems and that ""tens of thousands of people working on this around the clock."" When asked about the 2024 U.S. elections, Clegg points out that Meta has a large user base around the world and, as a result, is constantly having to prepare for elections, saying that ""with each election we learn more, because it's a very adversarial space."" ""I do think we are getting better. We have constant practice in doing this,"" Clegg adds. Click here to see the full interview with Nick Clegg.

Right now, it’s shaping up to be a “goldilocks” scenario, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes tells Yahoo Finance Live. “We finally have a goldilocks scenario where the slowing is starting to kick in, the lagged effect is starting to kick in, and more than anything what that means for the Fed is it gives them cover to actually pause in September, which is kind of priced into the markets right now,” Hayes says. Although many investors believe the Fed will hike in November, “we are going to get a lot of inflation data between now and then” and “if those numbers continue to come in a little bit softer, the Fed may be done in terms of hiking, not done with tightening cause they’ll keep rates elevated for a little while,” which “creates this perfect scenario for stocks moving forward,” Hayes explains. Hayes also notes that with some softness in the labor market, quit rates declining, job openings softening, “that creates an environment where you're not going to have the wage price spiral, where you're not going to see this accelerating wage inflation, and that’s going to give a lot of comfort to the Fed.” Let the Fed “keep rates elevated” and have this “perfect situation where the economy is slowing a little bit, but the Fed is done tightening and then companies can start to perform,” Hayes explains. Hayes says for people expecting the “Magnificent 7,” Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA), “to have a monster second half like they had the first half, I think they're going to be a little surprised.”, Headline: Alphabet Inc.
