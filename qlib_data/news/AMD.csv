However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape., Headline: Activist investor Dan Loeb builds passive stake in AMD, source:Reuters, summary: Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb on Thursday told investors in his hedge fund Third Point the firm has invested in chip designer Advanced Micro Devices, a source familiar with the matter said., Headline: Why Qualcomm Stock Lagged the Market on Thursday, source:Yahoo, summary: Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) stock couldn't quite keep pace with the broader market on Thursday, ending the day essentially flat while the S&P 500 index crept almost 0.8% higher.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says he thinks ""the worst is behind us at this point and our raise to the guide for Q3 really portends to a more optimistic future."" One of the big issues for Intel has been the slowdown in PC demand. On that Gelsinger says the company is ""expecting nice quarter-on-quarter improvements"" in that business, partly due to inventory adjustments. When it comes to AI, Gelsinger explains there are a couple of reasons why Intel's name isn't mentioned much in the conversation. One of the reasons Gelsinger gives is that ""we haven't been as aggressive out of the chute as we should've been."" Gelsinger says the company has to prove itself because ""we have a clear market leader who is executing very well."" Gelsinger says rival Nvidia (NVDA) ""has done a good job in this space. They've really led the way and I like to say, they worked super hard and they got lucky."" However, Gelsinger notes the AI space is still ""fairly young"" and there is still ""a lot of opportunity"" for Intel., Headline: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Weak Guidance from AMD Weighs on Chip Stocks, source:Yahoo, summary: The S&P 500 index finished 1.4% lower on August 2, 2023, after chipmaker AMD issued weaker-than-expected third-quarter guidance, which weighed on the sector., Headline: 3 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic, source:Yahoo, summary: Let's dig into three stocks well positioned to benefit from AI for years to come: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Duolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).
