Steve Pavlick, Renaissance Macro Research Head of Policy, notes there are several ways TikTok usage could be tailored by the U.S. government. One solution would be spearheaded by the Commerce Department, which could ban the use of TikTok in the U.S through restricting app downloads and limiting its role in commerce, Pavlick wrote recently. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), would lead the other charge. Regardless of the path to the limitations, Pavlick believes TikTok, which just eclipsed 150 million monthly active users, should be banned in the U.S. Social media stocks have popped on such speculation over the past month. Shares of Meta (META), Snap (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) have all risen over the last several weeks as the notion of banning TikTok has gained bipartisan support. In the video above, Pavlick joins Yahoo Finance's Dave Briggs and Seana Smith to explain why he believes TikTok should be banned.

There’s a chance the days of endlessly swiping through videos on the platform are numbered. So how did we get here? Alex Zhu and Luyu Yang originally launched an app called Musical.ly way back in 2014. It became especially popular in the U.S. among tweens and preteens who would use it to share videos of themselves lip syncing to songs. ByteDance, meanwhile, was already running TikTok, and seeing how popular Musical.ly was, bought the company for $1 billion in 2017. It merged the two apps in 2018, bringing all Musical.ly users over to TikTok and kickstarting what would become one of the world’s most popular social media platforms. But TikTok’s connection to China, coupled with the fact that it’s so popular with younger users, sent regulators and politicians in the U.S. and abroad into overdrive. The government’s beef with the app is over whether it’s shipping U.S. users’ data to China which then uses it to spy on Americans and spread pro-Beijing propaganda and disinformation. A number of states and federal agencies, not to mention the military, have banned the use of the app on official devices and networks.

""This app preys on children,"" Keith Krach, chairman of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, tells Yahoo! Finance. Krach, who served as former under secretary of state in the Trump administration, says the app monitors private information like bank records and location data. The app, which is ultimately owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has also seen criticism for allegations of censorship, access of U.S. user data, and propaganda concerns. TikTok's ownership has made it a long-running target by the U.S. government, with the Trump Administration saying in 2020 it would ban the app. TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before Congress today in the hopes of addressing some of these concerns. The executive said TikTok pledged commitments in four key areas: it would keep teenager safety a top priority, prevent unauthorized foreign access of U.S. user data, commit to free expression, and will be transparent and give access to monitors. Critics say the commitments do not go far enough. ""This app is built to be weaponized,"" says Keith Krach, chairman of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue.

But doing that will require more than just deleting the app from your phone. If you really want to give up TikTok, you’ll have to delete your account as well. Thankfully, it’s a relatively painless process, though the platform, like other social media companies, will certainly try to get you to stick around. To finally kick your TikTok habit, you’ll first want to go to your profile page by tapping the Profile button in the bottom right corner of the home screen. Select the options menu, by pressing the hamburger button in the top right of the screen, and tap Settings and Privacy in the pop-up window. Next press Account, then select Deactivate or Delete Account, and pick Delete account permanently. From there you can choose to download your old TikTok videos to save them offline, or you can just kiss them all goodbye by tapping the confirm button at the bottom of the screen.

With the Federal Reserve's next policy announcement coming up in May, investors are looking for light at the end of the rate-hike tunnel. Kenny Polcari, Kace Capital Advisors Managing Partner, tells Yahoo Finance that a Fed pause could be a benefit for the tech industry. Last week's weekly jobless claims bolstered bets that the Fed may pause its interest rate-hike cycle in an effort to tame inflation. ""I think the cuts come in 2024, and then I would expect tech to continue to perform well,"" Polcari says. If the Fed is forced into another position to raise rates due to rising inflation, Polcari says it would be bad for the industry. ""Tech isn't going to like that, and investors are going to take money out [of tech]...and a bunch of areas of tech...will immediately come under pressure,"" he says. Polcari spoke with Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith and Rachelle Akkuffo. Watch the entire interview here.

So that's the highest that we've ever seen,’ Mendelsohn told Garfinkle. That engagement drove Facebook and Meta’s (META) Q1 sales to $28.65 billion, up 3% from a year earlier and an increase after three straight periods of declining revenue. Mendelsohn said despite the increased competition Meta is very competitive in the advertising space. ‘What advertisers are telling me, and coming to me and talking about, is the fact that they see us as being absolutely key to helping their businesses grow and helping them reach the consumers that matter,’ she said. On AI, Mendelsohn said Meta is using it daily in a variety of ways including in newsfeeds, for ad targeting, and removing what it deems ‘harmful content.’ ‘We also use it to take off the platform any type of harmful content and misinformation.

Rhind referenced Nvidia as the ""poster for AI exposure"" in a note he wrote. Nvidia shares continue to reach all-time highs in 2023, rising 200% year-to-date. Meta is another tech stock investing in artificial intelligence. Rhind specifies that AI is ""real"" and that it's proving to not just be ""a short-term hype where people got in and in six months time have forgotten all about it."" U.S. home sales are stalling as housing prices climb higher, which is why Rhind wants to shy away from home improvement retailer Home Depot. New homes may be selling, but homeowners locked into mortgages are not spending as much on home repair as they were during the ""big reshuffle"" from pandemic spending trends. Lastly, Rhind finds there to be geopolitical and environmental concerns tied to how much higher energy company Exxon Mobil may climb.

After the meeting concluded, Meta's President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg told Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Allie Garfinkle that he believes all the tech companies at the meeting want to move AI technology forward quickly, but responsibly, adding that Meta is ""absolutely determined to follow-up and honor these commitments."" Clegg doesn't share the fears that some have of AI, saying that some of predictions ""have slightly run ahead of the technology."" Clegg does say concerns about things like deep fakes and the manipulation of audio and video are ""legitimate,"" but that ""the technology which generates that unwelcome material is also the technology we will use to actually identify and control it."" On regulation, Clegg said it is ""definitely"" needed, but that companies are not ""going to sit around an wait for legislation,"" noting that's part of the reason why these voluntary commitments are being made. One of the big concerns about AI is how it can be used to create misinformation or disinformation that could impact an election.

After its conclusion, Clegg joined Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Allie Garfinkle to shed light on what was discussed. One of the big concerns about AI is how it could be used to spread misinformation or disinformation in a way that could impact an election. Clegg says that Meta's systems, including the ones related to AI, will ""tackle"" malicious or nefarious content ""regardless of where its created, whether it's created by a human being or by a machine."" Clegg adds that Meta has spent $16 billion over the last few years on defensive and protective systems and that ""tens of thousands of people working on this around the clock."" When asked about the 2024 U.S. elections, Clegg points out that Meta has a large user base around the world and, as a result, is constantly having to prepare for elections, saying that ""with each election we learn more, because it's a very adversarial space."" ""I do think we are getting better. We have constant practice in doing this,"" Clegg adds. Click here to see the full interview with Nick Clegg.

TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his study on generative AI and why ""everybody is concerned about the usage of generative AI."" O'Donnell explains how ""Zoom's recording of your meetings is clearly a fear of loss of copyright"" because if companies are discussing their plans, new products, and ideas, ""that information is included in what Zoom is doing, that's a huge problem for companies. And that's one of the main factors why the few percentage of companies who are not yet using GenAI aren't doing so."" O'Donnell's study showed that security/data protection, inaccuracies, copyright, bias, and lack of watermarking were among the top concerns for generative AI use. O'Donnell says companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), ""are really going to have to go out of their way to really explain"" what they are going to do ""to avoid these concerns."", Headline: Biden administration tells US Supreme Court to review social media laws, source:Finnhub, summary: President Joe Biden's administrationurged the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a dispute overRepublican-backed laws in Texas and Florida that would undercutefforts by social media companies to curb..., Headline: Investors pummeled by tech in 2022 make new bets on sector in second quarter, source:Yahoo, summary: Several investment managers whose performance was pummeled when technology stocks skidded lower last year put fresh money into the handful of companies that are pulling the stock market higher this year, new regulatory filings show.

Right now, it’s shaping up to be a “goldilocks” scenario, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes tells Yahoo Finance Live. “We finally have a goldilocks scenario where the slowing is starting to kick in, the lagged effect is starting to kick in, and more than anything what that means for the Fed is it gives them cover to actually pause in September, which is kind of priced into the markets right now,” Hayes says. Although many investors believe the Fed will hike in November, “we are going to get a lot of inflation data between now and then” and “if those numbers continue to come in a little bit softer, the Fed may be done in terms of hiking, not done with tightening cause they’ll keep rates elevated for a little while,” which “creates this perfect scenario for stocks moving forward,” Hayes explains. Hayes also notes that with some softness in the labor market, quit rates declining, job openings softening, “that creates an environment where you're not going to have the wage price spiral, where you're not going to see this accelerating wage inflation, and that’s going to give a lot of comfort to the Fed.” Let the Fed “keep rates elevated” and have this “perfect situation where the economy is slowing a little bit, but the Fed is done tightening and then companies can start to perform,” Hayes explains. Hayes says for people expecting the “Magnificent 7,” Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA), “to have a monster second half like they had the first half, I think they're going to be a little surprised.”, Headline: Labor Day is just a ‘milestone’ in the marathon to get workers back to the office, source:MarketWatch, summary: No summary",META
