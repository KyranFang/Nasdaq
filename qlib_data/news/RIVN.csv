Auto reviewer and Cars and Bids auction platform founder Doug DeMuro points to Tesla's disappointing pipeline of new vehicle announcements and the lack of updates to its existing lineup. ""Tesla hasn't really shown us anything like they used to, where they can just drop something and wow everybody and stay years ahead,"" says DeMuro to Yahoo! Finance Live. The competition among automakers for EV buyers has intensified recently, with entries from new companies like Rivian (RIVN) aiming for the pickup and rugged truck market, and industry stalwarts like Ford (F), Volkswagen (VOW3.DE), and General Motors (GM) offering vehicles like the GMC Hummer EV. DeMuro says the competition has eroded Tesla's first-mover advantage, with some of the blame attributed to Tesla's lack of new updates in nearly a decade. DeMuro points to Tesla's pickup as one example. ""The cybertruck, which has been touted and vaunted for years, is late,"" he says. ""Rivian is already out with a pickup, General Motors is out with a pickup, Ford has the lightning."" When Tesla introduced new vehicles, ""It was so far ahead of everybody else that you couldn't catch up to Tesla,"" says DeMuro. ""In the ensuing 10 years, people have caught up to Tesla."" Above, Yahoo! Finance's Pras Subramanian and Brian Sozzi spoke to DeMuro.

Nobody is that close to Tesla. It's amazing how far ahead they are,' CoPilot Founder and CEO tells Yahoo Finance. Ryan says Tesla is able to accomplish this - and its competitors cannot - because 'Tesla basically went through the growing pains of learning how to build EVs sufficiently earlier and got through that gives them the margin advantage...they can afford to cut their prices and still be profitable.'  According to Ryan, several of Tesla's EV competitors are facing significant challenges - Ford (F) when it comes to profitability on its EV sales, and Rivian (RIVN) and Polestar (PSNY) on their decision to not cut prices on its vehicles. Ryan also advises used car shoppers on timing their next purchase, outlining some of the biggest challenges right now and explaining why buying waiting one to three months could yield greater benefits.

These projects can revolve around sustainability areas like clean transportation and renewable energy. The idea being companies can shift to more sustainable practices while funding the transition at a lower cost. There are rules for these bonds. They must be used for green projects only. Issuers of the bonds must lay out the criteria used to evaluate proposals. Proceeds from the bonds need to be tracked and information must be shared about those proceeds as well as the impact of those projects. Who can issue these bonds? Governments, non-profits, banks and corporations. Rivian isn't the only company to issue green bonds this year. Comcast (CMCSA) announced a $1 billion green bond sale. And VF Corporation (VFC) issued its second green bond for more than $500 million. See the full interview with Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith here.
