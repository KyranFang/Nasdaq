Yahoo Finance spoke to experts, analysts, and strategists across the industry to determine the potential impact on chipmakers like Nvidia, as well as the market implications. Callie Cox, eToro USA Investment Analyst, discussed the impact that the report is having on chipmaking stocks. Cox said, ""I think AI is a great story. I think it's hard to argue against the fact that it could change the world, but these bumps happen when we're talking about new technologies."" Matt Maley, Miller Tabak Managing Director and Equity Strategist, broke down the recent rally from AI stocks and chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). Maley said, ""It'll be interesting, not only this week, but moving to next week a lot of these institutions, they might start to pull back a little bit because of this concern."" Phil Orlando, Federated Hermes Chief Equity Strategist, discussed how geopolitical pressures could affect the rapid growth of AI-tied stocks. Orlando said, ""Might an air pocket be coming if that's the direction the Biden administration wants to go? Certainly that's something you can't rule out."" Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre also broke down the geopolitical pressures behind the report. Ferre said that according to Ted Mortonson, a Baird Technology Strategist, ""It is turning into almost a geopolitical economic warfare issue."" Ferre explained, ""When you are restricting the exportation of these chips, you are basically trying to restrict economic growth in one country, and you are also trying to restrict their military advancements.""
