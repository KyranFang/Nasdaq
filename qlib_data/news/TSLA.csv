Auto reviewer and Cars and Bids auction platform founder Doug DeMuro points to Tesla's disappointing pipeline of new vehicle announcements and the lack of updates to its existing lineup. ""Tesla hasn't really shown us anything like they used to, where they can just drop something and wow everybody and stay years ahead,"" says DeMuro to Yahoo! Finance Live. The competition among automakers for EV buyers has intensified recently, with entries from new companies like Rivian (RIVN) aiming for the pickup and rugged truck market, and industry stalwarts like Ford (F), Volkswagen (VOW3.DE), and General Motors (GM) offering vehicles like the GMC Hummer EV. DeMuro says the competition has eroded Tesla's first-mover advantage, with some of the blame attributed to Tesla's lack of new updates in nearly a decade. DeMuro points to Tesla's pickup as one example. ""The cybertruck, which has been touted and vaunted for years, is late,"" he says. ""Rivian is already out with a pickup, General Motors is out with a pickup, Ford has the lightning."" When Tesla introduced new vehicles, ""It was so far ahead of everybody else that you couldn't catch up to Tesla,"" says DeMuro. ""In the ensuing 10 years, people have caught up to Tesla."" Above, Yahoo! Finance's Pras Subramanian and Brian Sozzi spoke to DeMuro.

On one side are analysts who see an aggressive move by the leading manufacturer of EVs to gobble up sales and market share from its competitors just as they're beginning to bring more vehicles to market.  On the other side are critics who argue that with demand for Tesla's older vehicles beginning to wane, the company feels forced to slash prices to attract buyers., Headline: Tesla: Jefferies analysts raise price target for EV maker amid Model S, Model X price cuts, source:Yahoo, summary: Yahoo Finance autos reporter Pras Subramanian to discuss the markets' reaction to Tesla's latest price cuts., Headline: Used car dealers are ‘slower to drop’ prices on EV brands like Tesla: Expert, source:Yahoo, summary: CoPilot CEO Pat Ryan joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the used car market, EVs, Tesla, and retail car prices., Headline: 'There's nobody that close to Tesla': CoPilot CEO, source:Yahoo, summary: Tesla (TSLA) is slashing the prices for its two most expensive vehicles in the U.S. The EV giant announcing that prices for its Model S and Model X vehicles will be reduced between 4% and 9% as it looks to drive demand. Nobody is that close to Tesla. It's amazing how far ahead they are,' CoPilot Founder and CEO tells Yahoo Finance. Ryan says Tesla is able to accomplish this - and its competitors cannot - because 'Tesla basically went through the growing pains of learning how to build EVs sufficiently earlier and got through that gives them the margin advantage...they can afford to cut their prices and still be profitable.'  According to Ryan, several of Tesla's EV competitors are facing significant challenges - Ford (F) when it comes to profitability on its EV sales, and Rivian (RIVN) and Polestar (PSNY) on their decision to not cut prices on its vehicles. Ryan also advises used car shoppers on timing their next purchase, outlining some of the biggest challenges right now and explaining why buying waiting one to three months could yield greater benefits.

How Artificial Intelligence is Shaping the Future of Work, source:Yahoo, summary: Generative AI, augmented intelligence, machine learning- these topics have dominated the conversation around tech in 2023, and by now we’ve all heard the rumors: AI is coming for your job, it will take your family, and it will eat the food off your dinner plate, but is there any truth behind this? To find out more, we went to the ground floor of the new tech sector, where technology meets culture, and the South meets the Southwest. Webster’s dictionary defines AI as “the simulation of human behavior in computers”. Sounds harmless right? But with the exploding popularity of generative chat bots like ChatGPT, many people are reexamining where they stand on the technological food chain. Ian Beacraft is one of the leading voices in deep tech and AI. His company, Signal and Cipher, teaches large companies how to adapt to new technology. “Generative ai is here. it's in everyone's palms and it's not going anywhere,” says Ian, telling Yahoo Finance that we’ve only scratched the surface of what AI can do. “We are at the very beginning of one of the biggest revolutions in knowledge work in human history and a lot of people look at this as a large step change in the way that we do our work… what we're doing is we are digitizing skills the same way that we mechanized physical labor in the industrial revolution… we're doing things at a scale, at a volume, and at a breadth that human minds aren't really capable of.” So, will the rise of AI lead to job losses? And if so, why should we embrace this technology? We met with Garry Kasparov, the former chess Grandmaster, famous for his series of chess matches against the 1980’s supercomputer, “Deep Blue”. “Every new technology in the past has threatened jobs, actually destroyed jobs, destroyed industry before creating new opportunities,” Kasparov told us. “AI is not the exception. Machines made us stronger in the past, made us faster in the past… so, many jobs we are doing today, in my view, are like zombie jobs. They're already dead. They just don't know yet.” So far, our experts have not painted a particularly rosy picture for the future of mankind, so we went directly to the source. You know what they say- keep your enemies close. According to ChatGPT, “Artificial intelligence has the potential to greatly impact the future of humanity in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, AI has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, education, and transportation.” That doesn’t sound too bad, but it goes on: “One major concern is that as AI systems become more advanced, they may become difficult to control, potentially leading to unintended consequences or even catastrophic outcomes.” Therein lies the concern, and why many in the tech industry are approaching AI with a good deal of caution. “People are getting freaked out. They’re saying ‘Hey, what is this thing? Can we trust it?’” “I see both sides of the argument. and, you know, in some ways, there is a lot of opportunity, but on the other hand, we also have to be careful, just like with any technology,” says Pulkit Agrawal, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at MIT. Instead of thinking of AI as a replacement for human beings, according to Pulkit, we should think of AI as a tool. Like the invention of the PC, artificial intelligence may actually improve our work and make humans more efficient in performing our day-to-day tasks. “If an AI system can look at CT scans, and make a diagnosis, is it going to replace a doctor or not? I would say no. I think the right way to implement the system is to make the system be an advisor to a doctor, because this AI system has looked at more CT scans than any doctor could have looked in his life,” Pulkit says. While the possibilities for AI may seem limitless, it could be the key to unlocking the potential of the human brain.

Ultimately humans will be the winners and we'll see humans continue to get more creative and more productive…AI can be used in music to enhance production, consumption, many different things. and I think the possibilities are endless,” Fine says. So endless, that in just a few months AI generated artworks have spread across the internet like wildfire and developers made a boatload of money for what seemed like an original idea. “Especially in the art space, we have lawsuits that have been taking place around representation and compensation. Artists are often having their art put into the data set to train those models without any notification and without any compensation, notice, or attribution,” Signal and Cipher CEO, Ian Beacraft told us. “People have put out their life's work onto the internet, and now these models have come along and scrapes the whole internet and said ‘we're just training it on everything.”’ Theft of intellectual property is hardly a modern problem, but leave it to the free market to come up with a modern solution. Image licensing companies like Getty (GETY) and Shutterstock (SSTK) are diving head-first onto the AI wave, using their massive image databases to build AI content generators and sharing the profits with contributing artists. “The way that people tell stories is continuing to evolve. At one point it was images, then it was video,and now it's music. Now it may be generated content,” says Shutterstock Chief Product Officer Meghan Schoen. So what does the future of creativity look like? Schoen says, “the way I describe it is you're sitting in a pitch meeting or trying to bring an idea to life and you may have a vision in your head of astronauts eating breakfast on Mars. In the past, how do you actually describe that to a roomful of creatives? To help them understand and conceptualize what you're talking about? Now, they can just describe that, get a visual, and now they're not starting from a blank piece of paper… and they can build stories on top of that.”, Headline: Tesla Cuts Prices Again for its More Expensive Model S/X, source:Yahoo, summary: Tesla Inc.

The EV standard bearer is in a phase where ""they need to get growth"" to absorb the fixed costs they've built up, says Phillippe Houchois, Jefferies Managing Director, speaking with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman on Yahoo Finance Live. Houchois downgraded its shares to Hold from Buy, and dropped the price target to $185 from $230. Tesla shares slid sharply after first quarter results revealed those tighter margins; the selloff pushing Elon Musk's business below the half-trillion dollar mark. On the earnings call, its billionaire CEO stood his ground, saying the move toward higher volume ""is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin."" Even with the selloff sparked by first quarter earnings, Tesla is still up year-to-date while retaining some of the healthiest margins in the industry. Tesla's big push toward cutting prices is an evolution for the brand. Previously they were touted as expensive, ""premium cars"" Houchois says. Now the electric vehicle maker is ""improving affordability"" across the industry, but those big slashes cut into margins. Expanding volume will give Tesla ""an edge to reduce variable costs,"" Houchois says. But the automaker will need to ""grow 30% to actually absorb"" fixed costs. ""We just don't know exactly when the trough will be,"" Houchois says, adding ""it's an ongoing process."" In his full interview, Phillippe Houchois also spoke with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman about Tesla's (TSLA) need to expand EV lineups.

CFO John Lawler told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith the company is focused on profitability for its electric offerings, saying ""we are not going to sacrifice profitability just for share in volume"". The comments allude to Tesla's pricing strategy; Elon Musk told investors last month that ""pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice"" after lower prices narrowed margins for the automaker. Despite the comments, Ford unveiled cuts of it own. It's dropping the cost of its Mustang Mach-E by up to $4,000. It also laid out its first quarter earnings by division for the first time. Although the automaker beat overall expectations with strong revenue growth, its EV division revealed a pre-tax loss of $722 million. Ford expects it to turn operating margins positive by 2026. Ford is taking a ""balanced approach"" to EV pricing, Lawler says, making sure any adjustments serve the company well in the long run. When cutting costs, Ford will be ""thoughtful"" to keep that balance. Lawler added that Ford is at an advantage as one of the first movers in the EV space, which will help establish brand loyalty among new EV customers.

But there are growing concerns about whether those stocks have come too far, too fast.  Paul Meeks, Independent Solutions Wealth Management Portfolio Manager, tells Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita that he is worried about the valuations of tech stocks. Meeks cites two reasons. First is the AI hype. Meeks notes that a lot of companies spoke about AI on their earnings calls, but analysts didn't adjust their outlooks based on those comments, with the exception of Nvidia (NVDA). The second is interest rates. ""Tech and aggressive growth stocks need low interest rates,"" Meeks said, so the Federal Reserve's ""hawkish pause"" is a ""real incremental negative"" to tech stocks.  When it comes to specific stocks, Meeks says the two recent Alphabet (GOOGL) downgrades are ""legit,"" even though he likes the stock long term. Meeks says he is looking for defensive stocks within the tech sector. When it comes to defensive AI plays, Meeks specifically mentions Extreme Networks (EXTR) and AMD (AMD). Meeks also likes Uber Technologies (UBER) which he says is on a ""very visible path to profitability,"" while rival Lyft (LYFT) is ""a company that's badly damaged."" As far as Tesla (TSLA) is concerned, Meeks says the stock's performance is ""a bit worrisome,"" adding that it can sometimes be hard to value because ""it's more a cult.""  Meeks is less of a fan of Chinese tech stocks such as JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA) because of the China's weak economic recovery from the Covid pandemic.  Key video moments 00:00:55 Meeks on Alphabet downgrades 00:01:30 Meeks explains why he is concerned about tech valuations 00:03:14 How Meeks is playing AI 00:03:40 Best ways to play AI 00:04:45 What Meeks likes about Uber Technologies 00:05:19 Why Meeks is not a fan of some Chinese stocks 00:06:08 Meeks on Tesla, Headline: A.I. is not in a hype cycle, it's 'transformational technology,' says Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives, source:CNBC, summary: Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, says A.I. is not just hype but is something that will ""change the tech space for the next 20-30 years."", Headline: Threatened by shortages, electric car makers race for supplies of lithium for batteries, source:Associated Press, The, summary: No summary, Headline: Tesla Ventures Into Google Ads To Rev Up Marketing Game, source:Benzinga, summary: No summary, Headline: Threatened by shortages, electric car makers race for supplies of lithium for batteries, source:Associated Press, The, summary: No summary",TSLA

Price is a theme Fisker highlights, saying when it comes to demand for a sub-$30,000 EV or cheaper electric pickup truck ""we don't know because there isn't any."" However, Fisker is optimistic, stating, ""we believe that the demand will be there if there's a cool product."" The Fisker Alaska will likely ultimately be compared to Tesla's (TSLA) Cybertruck. While the price of the Cybertruck is yet to be announced, it remains one of the most talked about trucks in the EV market. Fisker also discussed the company's decision to manufacture cars in the U.S. that it sells in the U.S. Purchase volume will be a key factor in the company's manufacturing success, with Fisker explaining ""as long as we get a volume that's above 50,000 for each model, then it makes sense to make it locally."" Fisker also weighed in on incentives that were passed. ""It takes at least two-and-a-half years to get a factory from scratch up and running and I think it would've been fair to wait these two-and-a-half years, but they decided to do different"", Fisker said, adding that it hasn't impacted his company ""a lot."", Headline: Market Rally At Inflection Point, What To Do Now; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Earnings Due, source:Yahoo, summary: The market rally is at an infection point after significant losses.

Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets Lead Equity Analyst of Global Autos, and David Whiston, Morningstar U.S. Autos Equity Analyst, join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how a potential strike will impact the auto industry. On the potential UAW strike, Whiston says this is the fifth round of contract talks he has experienced, but ""this is the most worried I’ve been about any of them."" Whiston says the UAW's demands are effectively asking for the automakers to ""go back to how things were in the 20th century with everyone having a pension and retiree healthcare."" ""Many of those workers have seen their parents or their grandparents have those benefits, but it’s just not economically feasible anymore,"" Whiston explains. Narayan and Whiston also discuss pricing in the auto industry. Narayan says, ""the big topic really for the carmakers is pricing and price normalization."" Price normalization is ""a bigger threat, I think, to the auto industry than this one-time hit that’ll happen with the strike or financial costs raising somewhat,"" Narayan explains. Narayan notes that with the Inflation Reduction Act, automakers will get more money to produce batteries domestically so ""you’re going to see a lot of price deflation actually, I think, on EVs,"" adding that he thinks ultimately it will be cheaper to buy an EV than a gas-powered car., Headline: Homebuilder sentiment falls, VinFast stock pops, Tesla's cheaper models: Top Stories, source:Yahoo, summary: Yahoo Finance Live recaps the day's top stories including: Homebuilder sentiment fell for the first time in seven months, dropping 6 points to 50, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.

Right now, it’s shaping up to be a “goldilocks” scenario, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes tells Yahoo Finance Live. “We finally have a goldilocks scenario where the slowing is starting to kick in, the lagged effect is starting to kick in, and more than anything what that means for the Fed is it gives them cover to actually pause in September, which is kind of priced into the markets right now,” Hayes says. Although many investors believe the Fed will hike in November, “we are going to get a lot of inflation data between now and then” and “if those numbers continue to come in a little bit softer, the Fed may be done in terms of hiking, not done with tightening cause they’ll keep rates elevated for a little while,” which “creates this perfect scenario for stocks moving forward,” Hayes explains. Hayes also notes that with some softness in the labor market, quit rates declining, job openings softening, “that creates an environment where you're not going to have the wage price spiral, where you're not going to see this accelerating wage inflation, and that’s going to give a lot of comfort to the Fed.” Let the Fed “keep rates elevated” and have this “perfect situation where the economy is slowing a little bit, but the Fed is done tightening and then companies can start to perform,” Hayes explains. Hayes says for people expecting the “Magnificent 7,” Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA), “to have a monster second half like they had the first half, I think they're going to be a little surprised.”, Headline: Tesla Executive in Purchasing Probe Draws Scrutiny From US, source:Yahoo, summary: (Bloomberg) -- A Tesla Inc. plan to purchase hard-to-get construction materials is being investigated by US prosecutors, who are looking at whether the project was an appropriate use of company funds.Most Read from BloombergUS Health Officials Urge Moving Pot to Lower-Risk CategoryStocks Up Again in ‘Bad News Is Good News’ World: Markets WrapSingapore S$1 Billion Laundering Scandal Embroils Its Banking GiantsFed Ramps Up Demands for Corrective Actions by Regional BanksApple Tests Using 3D Printe, Headline: DOJ, SEC Investigate Tesla Over Secret Glass House Project, source:Yahoo, summary: Prosecutors are investigating Tesla’s use of company funds on a project that had been described internally as a house for Elon Musk., Headline: 'Magnificent Seven' playbook: What to know about Tesla, source:Yahoo, summary: Tesla (TSLA) shares have more than doubled this year, but does the EV maker’s stock fundamentals hold up or is it an investment based on faith in the company?
