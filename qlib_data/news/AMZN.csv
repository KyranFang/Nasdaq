But there could still be a case for why the Commanders are worth the price. There’s the obvious point that many think owning an NFL team is fun and beneficial to their image. Jerry Jones told Yahoo Finance in September that he wouldn’t sell the Dallas Cowboys for $10 billion. But there’s also underlying value. In 2021, the Green Bay Packers were 70 percent of the way to profitability before even playing a down, due to the NFL’s generous shared revenue model. Combine that, with consistent franchise valuations over time and the increased involvement of big tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL), the NFL’s growth story is likely to continue.

It is the average price for the day, weighted by volume, with each share traded getting equal weight. The cumulative average builds throughout the day, and if more volume comes in on an up move, the VWAP will rise, but if more volume comes in as the market moves lower, the VWAP will decline, and prices will be below it. According to veteran trader and alphatrends.net founder Brian Shannon, CMT, we can determine with 100% accuracy who has control at the beginning of the day based on where the VWAP is in relation to it. When thinking about support and resistance levels, traders use the word ""porosity,"" which is similar to drawing a trendline with a crayon instead of a straight edge, where the VWAP becomes a battleground in that area. He calls them levels of interest rather than levels of resistance. The anchored VWAP initiated from the all-time high for the NASDAQ, for instance. It measures sentiments with precision and tells us that from that top, the average long participant is losing money because the price is lower than the average, while the average short seller is making money. Shannon advises that as the market comes up to the anchored VWAP, not only will long people be looking to break even, but short sellers might put a big offer on there and try to scare the long holders out of it. He sees it as a transition of a balance of power, and if buyers are able to wrestle away control and take control of the trend, prices can re-emerge in a new uptrend supported by the average participant being in a profitable position and the average short seller scrambling to cover their losses. Shannon advises looking at the shorter-term timeframe for trend alignment and measuring sentiment and psychology to determine who is in control from a particular event. He suggests measuring VWAP from an event and looking for the first couple of days or two, where buyers gain control, and then a battle ensues where sellers regain control. By analyzing the sentiment and psychology, traders can determine whether the buyers or sellers have regained control and make informed trading decisions., Headline: Amazon.com Inc. stock underperforms Thursday when compared to competitors, source:MarketWatch, summary: Shares of Amazon.com Inc. dropped 0.04% to $92.13 Thursday, on what proved to be an all-around great trading session for the stock market, with the S&P 500..., Headline: Amazon's Vital Revenue Driver AWS Weighs $6B Investment In Malaysia, source:Yahoo, summary: Amazon.Com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) divulged plans to launch an AWS infrastructure Region in Malaysia.

It’s South by Southwest, an annual celebration that’s billed as both a conference and a festival, or somewhere in the middle, but as organizers and veterans will tell you, ‘you just have to be there.’ It’s a mashup of film, music, tech, and culture. A place where you can watch Ironman lecture a crowd on cyber-security, receive healthcare advice from the Jonas Brothers, and watch a movie premiere in virtual reality, all in one afternoon. But why is this happening? And who’s going? Well, everyone- fans, entrepreneurs, thrill seekers, investors, and they’re all going for the same reason- they’re looking for the next big thing. For the first time in a long time, the tech sector is experiencing a transformation. You’ve read about it in the news, heard about it in the break room, and you’ve seen it with your own eyes on social media. I’m talking about AI and what some are calling “deep tech” – those scientific advancements which include innovations in areas like virtual reality and robotics. Between star studded conversations and out-of-this-world exhibits, SXSW will give us a sneak peak into the future and how these new technologies will change our economy and our world, from the way we work, to the way we play. We’ll be speaking to the top thinkers and up and coming entrepreneurs about what all of this means for both businesses and consumers, because we’re on the edge of a brand new era in modern technology, and SXSW is the main stage. Over the past few years, there’s been a shift in how we think about the tech industry and the emergence of a new capital city for American business. Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL)— why are the world’s most valuable companies all moving to Austin, Texas? Could it be the weather? The taxes? The food?

All the big retail names were there including the tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and PayPal (PYPL), as well as giants of main street such as Foot Locker (FL) and Walmart (WMT). First, AI - artificial intelligence - is having its moment. It’s the ultimate buzzword in the field of investing, and AI was definitely on display at Shoptalk 2023. Tech companies are working with retailers to monetize a lot of the big data they’re collecting in real time. “I think as we see this next generation of AI it’s really powerful. And I think one of the most important questions out there is what are people going to ask it to do?” Pinterest CEO Bill Ready told us. The second major trend at Shoptalk was shipping. Retailers are battling to get all those products you buy online to your doorstep even faster. Shipt, which is owned by Target (TGT), is one of the big players. Twenty two billion packages are shipped every year in the United States according to a recent study by Pitney Bowes (PBI). The size of the package delivery market in the U.S. is expected to hit $157B this year, helping to explain the focus at Shoptalk on delivery solutions.

Speculation spread on Tuesday of a potential bid from the tech giant after a substack post from The Intersect. Shares of AMC spiked more than 15% on the news Tuesday, before Pachter and Wedbush wrote to clients the deal was “unlikely.” Pachter highlights there’s been no indication that AMC wants to sell itself as one of the key reasons the deal is unlikely. And even if AMC did want to sell itself, Amazon could find a more attractive option anyway, according to Pachter. The analyst points to Cineworld (CINE.L), which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, as a better potential target for Amazon. Given the bankruptcy, Cineworld’s screens could sell for roughly $600 million less than an AMC screen and therefore would be a significantly better purchase. In the video above, Yahoo Finance’s Dave Briggs and Seana Smith discuss the potential purchase with Pachter.

Rushkoff says that when it comes to regulating artificial intelligence, the easiest way ""isn't to change what A.I.s do, it's to change what we do."" ""Raising A.I. is a bit like raising children,"" he adds, ""they're going to listen to whatever is going on in the room.""

Wojcicki says she’s ‘disappointed’ in the lack of progress around genomics, despite having just crossed a significant milestone, 20 years since the first complete sequencing of the human genome. “I think part of the reason is that genetics tells you a lot about what you're at risk for and it doesn't necessarily financially pay to get you that preventative information and to intervene in that way versus just treating people once they have a disease.” The 23andME (ME) CEO also says they are looking into building new partnerships with pharmaceutical companies once the company’s partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) ends in July.

The companies agreed to voluntary safeguards to better manage the risks posed by AI. After the meeting concluded, Meta's President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg told Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Allie Garfinkle that he believes all the tech companies at the meeting want to move AI technology forward quickly, but responsibly, adding that Meta is ""absolutely determined to follow-up and honor these commitments."" Clegg doesn't share the fears that some have of AI, saying that some of predictions ""have slightly run ahead of the technology."" Clegg does say concerns about things like deep fakes and the manipulation of audio and video are ""legitimate,"" but that ""the technology which generates that unwelcome material is also the technology we will use to actually identify and control it."" On regulation, Clegg said it is ""definitely"" needed, but that companies are not ""going to sit around an wait for legislation,"" noting that's part of the reason why these voluntary commitments are being made. One of the big concerns about AI is how it can be used to create misinformation or disinformation that could impact an election.

After its conclusion, Clegg joined Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Allie Garfinkle to shed light on what was discussed.

Clegg says that Meta's systems, including the ones related to AI, will ""tackle"" malicious or nefarious content ""regardless of where its created, whether it's created by a human being or by a machine."" Clegg adds that Meta has spent $16 billion over the last few years on defensive and protective systems and that ""tens of thousands of people working on this around the clock."" When asked about the 2024 U.S. elections, Clegg points out that Meta has a large user base around the world and, as a result, is constantly having to prepare for elections, saying that ""with each election we learn more, because it's a very adversarial space.""

Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible."" Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on."", Headline: Google stock rises as it says it will charge $30 for enterprise AI service, source:Yahoo, summary: Google says it will charge $30 per month for its new enterprise AI platform., Headline: Amazon CEO says 'it’s probably not going work out' for employees who defy return-to-office policy, source:Yahoo, summary: Amazon employees have been pushing back against the company’s return-to-office policy for months — and it seems CEO Andy Jassy has had enough.

Right now, it’s shaping up to be a “goldilocks” scenario, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes tells Yahoo Finance Live. “We finally have a goldilocks scenario where the slowing is starting to kick in, the lagged effect is starting to kick in, and more than anything what that means for the Fed is it gives them cover to actually pause in September, which is kind of priced into the markets right now,” Hayes says. Although many investors believe the Fed will hike in November, “we are going to get a lot of inflation data between now and then” and “if those numbers continue to come in a little bit softer, the Fed may be done in terms of hiking, not done with tightening cause they’ll keep rates elevated for a little while,” which “creates this perfect scenario for stocks moving forward,” Hayes explains. Hayes also notes that with some softness in the labor market, quit rates declining, job openings softening, “that creates an environment where you're not going to have the wage price spiral, where you're not going to see this accelerating wage inflation, and that’s going to give a lot of comfort to the Fed.” Let the Fed “keep rates elevated” and have this “perfect situation where the economy is slowing a little bit, but the Fed is done tightening and then companies can start to perform,” Hayes explains. Hayes says for people expecting the “Magnificent 7,” Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA), “to have a monster second half like they had the first half, I think they're going to be a little surprised.”, Headline: Shopify's stock pops after latest Amazon collaboration, source:MarketWatch, summary: Shopify shares rose 4% in Wednesday's aftermarket action after Amazon announced an enhanced collaboration between the two companies., Headline: Amazon Announces App Integration for Merchants to Enable Buy with Prime on Shopify Stores, source:Yahoo, summary: SEATTLE, August 30, 2023--Today, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced the Buy with Prime app for Shopify, a new app integration that makes it easy for merchants to offer Buy with Prime on Shopify stores.

MNTN CEO Mark Douglas joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the comments. “If you look at the economics on it, I’m not sure how that quite works,” Douglas says. Douglas notes that Disney (DIS) “did about $10 billion in studio revenue last year,” whereas Netflix (NFLX) did “three times that, just by themselves. So they’re the size of like a couple of major studios combined, so I don’t know how you take an industry that seems to be largely striking over streaming and try to separate it out.” “Whenever these studios are in trouble, it’s like the finance team takes over and it just doesn’t make sense,” Douglas says. “These studios have to meet consumers where they are. The consumer sees no difference,” Douglas discusses. Douglas also notes that this is “not new. All this talk was on DVDs,” 20, 30 years ago as well. “Every time there’s a new technology, it’s like everyone’s up in arms over it. And so, bottom line, focus on the consumer, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and... we can go forward with everyone entertained and the industry in a healthy state,” Douglas adds., Headline: Like Amazon And Google, Salesforce Is Optimistic About The Remaining Half Of The Year, source:Yahoo, summary: On Wednesday, Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM) surpassed Wall Street estimates with its quarterly results, with its shares rising 6% during extended trading in response.
