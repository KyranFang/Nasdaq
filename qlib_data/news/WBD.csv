The company once vowed to be a disruptor to the media industry, but could not figure out a way to turn a profit. Washington Post media reporter Elahe Izadi says digital media organizations made the following claims early on, ""We are the future of media. We can attract millennials, younger audiences, newspapers are dying, print is dying, and this is really the future and they sold this promise, and as we can see, they couldn't grow fast enough to make up for those promises, especially when we're now in an economic environment where the advertising industry and the and the advertising revenue has dropped off."" Its potential downfall underscores the tough environment facing digital media companies as they struggle to cut spending during economic uncertainty. ""When we're talking digital media... during the pandemic and especially at the start, we actually saw audience spike, there was a lot of online interest, reader interest saw a lot of that happening, but that didn't necessarily mean an increase in revenues,"" Elahe Izadi said. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Izadi also says that in the case of companies relying on other companies like those who rely on Google (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), their businesses can also be susceptible to disruptions from something like a changed algorithm.

Apple is a strong distribution platform, and would stand to benefit from buying a ""successful and healthy film studio."" Enter: Disney.

It's $3,499 price tag however may turn off a lot of buyers. Laura Martin, Senior Media and Internet Analyst at Needham & Co., however, has an idea. Martin suggests that Apple (AAPL) should buy Disney (DIS) to help build adoption of the new headset. Martin argues that Apple needs ""a compelling content storytelling use case"" for the Vision Pro to gain traction. She believes that with Disney's content, more people may be willing to purchase the headset. But what about the Disney parks? Martin says Apple likely won't want the parks, but that those could be spun off or sold, given they are ""really a good business, standalone."" Martin also covers Warner Bros Discovery (WBD). When asked about the ousting of CNN CEO Chris Licht, Martin says investors are betting more on WBD leadership than who is leading CNN. She also makes the case for WBD keeping CNN in its portfolio. ""The only way to win the streaming wars is you must have entertainment content, and you must have news, and you must have live sports,"" Martin says, because when news breaks, it drives viewers to your app. When it comes to the ongoing writers strike and a potential strike from SAG-AFTRA, Martin tells Yahoo Finance Live's Diane King Hall and Alexandra Canal that Wall Street investors will ultimately be the winners because ""all of these companies are not going to be able to spend money on content and that won't be a competitive disadvantage.""

As customers continue cutting the chord and moving to streaming services, ""it makes sense that sports is moving over"" as well, Baysinger says. ""In terms of how to figure out the future of ESPN, I mean, Disney has been very open that they are looking for some kind of strategic partner,"" Baysinger says. Baysinger explains that Disney has ""held talks with multiple different companies"" including the NBA, NFL, and MLB, ""so they’re clearly looking far and wide for someone to help them with this full-streaming version of ESPN."" Baysinger notes that ""a full-streaming version of ESPN is going to be easily the most expensive, you know, streaming service on the market."" ""Sports rights are not cheap, they’re only going to get more expensive"" and with ESPN’s sports deals, ""their costs are only going up,"" Baysinger says., Headline: The Score: Macy’s, Nvidia, Warner Bros.

Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings. Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible."" Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""",WBD

On Wednesday, Thompson was given an equally daunting challenge: leading CNN, a one-time cable-news juggernaut that is struggling not only to find a programming strategy to better compete with rivals Fox News and MSNBC, but also a business model for the streaming era., Headline: Hollywood strikes, subscriber churn, sports rights: Big media woes, source:Yahoo, summary: Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has named former BBC and New York Times executive Mark Thompson as its CEO. It comes at a time of great change for the media industry. Traditional media companies like Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), and Warner Bros. Discovery are seeing their cable businesses decline while they are investing a lot of money in their streaming businesses. Activate CEO Michael Wolf says all of these companies are trying to position themselves for the ""direct-to-consumer"" future and, as a result, they will increase their spending on content. Several of the big streamers have started raising prices. Wolf says thinks that, in the future, viewers are going to ""churn in and out among these services, price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services,"" Wolf tells Yahoo Finance Live. When it comes to the Hollywood strikes, Wolf calls the timing of the strikes ""inopportune,"" saying the ""profit pools for programming production are drying up"" and that the ""revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled.""",WBD

Here some of Yahoo Finance Live's top takeaways. Lower income households are feeling recessionary, as recent earnings reports from retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe’s (LOW) show a cautious consumer, as they pull back on big-ticket spending and shift to spending on services versus goods. Yahoo Finance’s Brad Smith notes ""consumers are continuing to be extremely judicious"" about where they’re purchasing items. The July JOLTS report showed that the number of job openings slipped to 8.8 million in July, which fell short of the expected 9.5 million. Companies such as Dollar General (DG), Five Below (FIVE), and Nordstrom (JWN), all said they are feeling the impact of shrink hitting their bottom lines.

Recently, media mogul Barry Diller warned of consequences for studios if they continue partnering with streaming companies like Netflix (NFLX). MNTN CEO Mark Douglas joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the comments. “If you look at the economics on it, I’m not sure how that quite works,” Douglas says. Douglas notes that Disney (DIS) “did about $10 billion in studio revenue last year,” whereas Netflix (NFLX) did “three times that, just by themselves. So they’re the size of like a couple of major studios combined, so I don’t know how you take an industry that seems to be largely striking over streaming and try to separate it out.” “Whenever these studios are in trouble, it’s like the finance team takes over and it just doesn’t make sense,” Douglas says. “These studios have to meet consumers where they are. The consumer sees no difference,” Douglas discusses. Douglas also notes that this is “not new. All this talk was on DVDs,” 20, 30 years ago as well. “Every time there’s a new technology, it’s like everyone’s up in arms over it. And so, bottom line, focus on the consumer, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and... we can go forward with everyone entertained and the industry in a healthy state,” Douglas adds.",WBD
