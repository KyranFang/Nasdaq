What effect will this have on the economy as electricity prices continue to rise? Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to discuss how investors can benefit during these unprecedented times. A Dartmouth study calculated that extreme heat could cost countries between 1.5% - 6.7% of their GDP each year. A co-author of that study, Christopher Callahan, Dartmouth EEES PhD Candidate explained, ""When heat waves get more intense, economic growth goes down. And this can have compounding economic consequences. Laurence Chandy, UNICEF Director of the Office of Global Insight and Policy, emphasized the opportunity to invest in green energy. Chandy said, ""There are huge economic opportunities for people who want to invest in the green transition."" Raymond James Managing Director Pavel Molchanov broke down the impact of global water scarcity and how to combat it through desalination. Molchanov explained, ""Desalination is a vital aspect of what we call climate adaptation ... taking water from the ocean, removing the salt, and the result is water suitable for drinking, cooking, everything else. Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick discussed how rising electricity prices are impacting consumers. Sosnick said, ""If you have a fixed budget, and you're spending more of it to just keep the house cool to survive, that money's not going to be spent on other things."" Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Ines Ferre broke down the impact of the heatwave on air conditioning stocks. Ferre said, ""Those excessive heat warnings, the air quality warnings as well, that is giving AC stocks a boost.""
