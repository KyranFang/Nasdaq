However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape., Headline: Weekly comic: Make way for Generative AI, source:Yahoo, summary: By Geoffrey Smith, Headline: Why Take-Two Interactive Stock Leaped 6% Higher Today, source:Yahoo, summary: Rumor of a potential buyout from a big-pocketed strategic investor was inflating the share price of video game company Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ: TTWO) on Thursday.

Benioff said he welcomed the new board members and said they’ll be great for the company and its shareholders. “We have three great new board members, and that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible” Benioff said. The three new boardroom hires at Salesforce are Sachin Mehra, Mastercard’s Chief Financial Officer; Mason Morfit, ValueAct Capital’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Arnold Donald, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation. Benioff had particular praise for Donald: “probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world” he told Yahoo Finance. Benioff however, did not mention the more aggressive activists targeting Salesforce, specifically Elliott Management or Starboard Value. Benioff spoke to Yahoo Finance after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter. Some analysts mused that the blowout results could also help Benioff outflank the activists currently circling his company., Headline: Microsoft`s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing AI Rollout: Paving the Way for Growth, source:TipRanks, summary: No summary, Headline: Big US Stocks` Q4`22 Fundamentals, source:TalkMarkets, summary: No summary, Headline: Barclays Sticking with Alphabets amid AI Arms Race, source:TipRanks, summary: No summary, Headline: Microsoft Stock: Cloud Deal Activity Confirms the Bull Thesis, source:TipRanks, summary: No summary, Headline: BTIG starts The Trade Desk at Neutral, but with upbeat outlook, source:Seeking Alpha, summary: No summary, Headline: My Dividend Growth Income - February 2023 Update, source:SeekingAlpha, summary: Forward dividend income grew by $71.65, translating to M/M growth of 1.27%.

In Fe, Headline: Will AI Take Your Job? How Artificial Intelligence is Shaping the Future of Work, source:Yahoo, summary: Generative AI, augmented intelligence, machine learning- these topics have dominated the conversation around tech in 2023, and by now we’ve all heard the rumors: AI is coming for your job, it will take your family, and it will eat the food off your dinner plate, but is there any truth behind this? To find out more, we went to the ground floor of the new tech sector, where technology meets culture, and the South meets the Southwest. Webster’s dictionary defines AI as “the simulation of human behavior in computers”. Sounds harmless right? But with the exploding popularity of generative chat bots like ChatGPT, many people are reexamining where they stand on the technological food chain. Ian Beacraft is one of the leading voices in deep tech and AI. His company, Signal and Cipher, teaches large companies how to adapt to new technology. “Generative ai is here. it's in everyone's palms and it's not going anywhere,” says Ian, telling Yahoo Finance that we’ve only scratched the surface of what AI can do. “We are at the very beginning of one of the biggest revolutions in knowledge work in human history and a lot of people look at this as a large step change in the way that we do our work… what we're doing is we are digitizing skills the same way that we mechanized physical labor in the industrial revolution… we're doing things at a scale, at a volume, and at a breadth that human minds aren't really capable of.” So, will the rise of AI lead to job losses? And if so, why should we embrace this technology? We met with Garry Kasparov, the former chess Grandmaster, famous for his series of chess matches against the 1980’s supercomputer, “Deep Blue”. “Every new technology in the past has threatened jobs, actually destroyed jobs, destroyed industry before creating new opportunities,” Kasparov told us. “AI is not the exception. Machines made us stronger in the past, made us faster in the past… so, many jobs we are doing today, in my view, are like zombie jobs. They're already dead. They just don't know yet.” So far, our experts have not painted a particularly rosy picture for the future of mankind, so we went directly to the source. You know what they say- keep your enemies close. According to ChatGPT, “Artificial intelligence has the potential to greatly impact the future of humanity in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, AI has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, education, and transportation.” That doesn’t sound too bad, but it goes on: “One major concern is that as AI systems become more advanced, they may become difficult to control, potentially leading to unintended consequences or even catastrophic outcomes.” Therein lies the concern, and why many in the tech industry are approaching AI with a good deal of caution. “People are getting freaked out. They’re saying ‘Hey, what is this thing? Can we trust it?’” “I see both sides of the argument. and, you know, in some ways, there is a lot of opportunity, but on the other hand, we also have to be careful, just like with any technology,” says Pulkit Agrawal, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at MIT. Instead of thinking of AI as a replacement for human beings, according to Pulkit, we should think of AI as a tool. Like the invention of the PC, artificial intelligence may actually improve our work and make humans more efficient in performing our day-to-day tasks. “If an AI system can look at CT scans, and make a diagnosis, is it going to replace a doctor or not? I would say no. I think the right way to implement the system is to make the system be an advisor to a doctor, because this AI system has looked at more CT scans than any doctor could have looked in his life,” Pulkit says. While the possibilities for AI may seem limitless, it could be the key to unlocking the potential of the human brain.

Concerns still abound however, and a well-known figure has entered the chat. Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai told '60 Minutes' artificial intelligence could be very ""harmful"" if used incorrectly, and called for further regulatory frameworks. That's a sentiment echoed by Douglas Rushkoff, Professor of Media Theory and Digital Economics at CUNY; he told Yahoo Finance Live that regulation is ""a necessary framework."" The conversation was timely, with EU lawmakers reportedly drawing up plans to regulate the space with a new set of tailored rules. The U.S. Commerce Department has also set out its stall; it's currently fielding opinions on the need for A.I. audits and risk assessments. Rushkoff says that when it comes to regulating artificial intelligence, the easiest way ""isn't to change what A.I.s do, it's to change what we do."" ""Raising A.I. is a bit like raising children,"" he adds, ""they're going to listen to whatever is going on in the room.""

After its conclusion, Clegg joined Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Allie Garfinkle to shed light on what was discussed. One of the big concerns about AI is how it could be used to spread misinformation or disinformation in a way that could impact an election. Clegg says that Meta's systems, including the ones related to AI, will ""tackle"" malicious or nefarious content ""regardless of where its created, whether it's created by a human being or by a machine."" Clegg adds that Meta has spent $16 billion over the last few years on defensive and protective systems and that ""tens of thousands of people working on this around the clock."" When asked about the 2024 U.S. elections, Clegg points out that Meta has a large user base around the world and, as a result, is constantly having to prepare for elections, saying that ""with each election we learn more, because it's a very adversarial space.""

You know, it really did tell you, equity investors have not wanted to chase this move. So, if given an excuse to pull out, they’re going to do it. They’re going to wait for more reasonable valuations to come back in,” Calvasina said. Calvasina explains how “it’s not all about the long-term growth expectations.

So we actually still like tech longer term, but in the short term, I don’t think you can get around that fact that it’s a headwind for a trade that’s become very, very crowded.”, Headline: Investors Are Dropping Billions on Startups in the AI Craze, source:Yahoo, summary: When news leaked earlier this year that Microsoft had invested billions of dollars into OpenAI -- the company behind the revolutionary ChatGPT tool -- this led to rumblings of additional investments..., Headline: Tech earnings: What investors have learned so far, source:Yahoo, summary: So far, six of the ""magnificent seven"" tech companies have reported their quarterly results: Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA).

TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his study on generative AI and why ""everybody is concerned about the usage of generative AI."" O'Donnell explains how ""Zoom's recording of your meetings is clearly a fear of loss of copyright"" because if companies are discussing their plans, new products, and ideas, ""that information is included in what Zoom is doing, that's a huge problem for companies. And that's one of the main factors why the few percentage of companies who are not yet using GenAI aren't doing so."" O'Donnell's study showed that security/data protection, inaccuracies, copyright, bias, and lack of watermarking were among the top concerns for generative AI use. O'Donnell says companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), ""are really going to have to go out of their way to really explain"" what they are going to do ""to avoid these concerns."", Headline: Netflix is getting into game streaming.

Investopedia Editor-In-Chief Caleb Silver joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. “I don’t think we've seen” a Minksy moment in AI, Silver says, “we’ve seen a nice healthy pullback after a really strong rally.” Investors are “worried we might be at the brink of something.

But Nvidia’s got a lot going for it, it doesn’t just surround itself in the AI ecosystem.” “We’ve seen a big selloff in AI-related stocks lately, absent Nvidia... so some of the air may have been let out of the AI bubble a little bit and we're going to see which companies remain that have the most strength in that area and can use it to enhance their businesses and their profitability,” Silver explains., Headline: UPDATE 1-Google unveils AI tools for enterprise customers at $30 a month, source:Yahoo, summary: Google on Tuesday made its artificial intelligence-powered tools available to enterprise customers at a monthly price of $30 per user, as the Alphabet-owned firm looks to cash in on the technology's surge in popularity this year.

Versace says that although we are starting to see some benefits to AI, there is ""a lot more to go.""

Versace goes on to say that ""the more concrete examples we have of where AI is showing real benefits to companies, I think, the more real the AI revolution becomes, in the near term."" The biggest winner of this AI hype cycle has been Nvidia (NVDA). Versace admits his firm missed out on Nvidia's move, having chosen to invest in Marvell Technology (MRVL).

Right now, it’s shaping up to be a “goldilocks” scenario, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes tells Yahoo Finance Live. “We finally have a goldilocks scenario where the slowing is starting to kick in, the lagged effect is starting to kick in, and more than anything what that means for the Fed is it gives them cover to actually pause in September, which is kind of priced into the markets right now,” Hayes says. Although many investors believe the Fed will hike in November, “we are going to get a lot of inflation data between now and then” and “if those numbers continue to come in a little bit softer, the Fed may be done in terms of hiking, not done with tightening cause they’ll keep rates elevated for a little while,” which “creates this perfect scenario for stocks moving forward,” Hayes explains. Hayes also notes that with some softness in the labor market, quit rates declining, job openings softening, “that creates an environment where you're not going to have the wage price spiral, where you're not going to see this accelerating wage inflation, and that’s going to give a lot of comfort to the Fed.” Let the Fed “keep rates elevated” and have this “perfect situation where the economy is slowing a little bit, but the Fed is done tightening and then companies can start to perform,” Hayes explains. Hayes says for people expecting the “Magnificent 7,” Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA), “to have a monster second half like they had the first half, I think they're going to be a little surprised.”, Headline: Microsoft (MSFT) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know, source:Yahoo, summary: In the latest trading session, Microsoft (MSFT) closed at $328.79, marking a +0.12% move from the previous day., Headline: Don’t want to go to a work meeting?
